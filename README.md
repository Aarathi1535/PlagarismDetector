# Plagiarism Detector using Python
In this project, the user can compare two files to find the percentage of plagiarism between them.
The project is built using Python.
- Firstly, I used SequenceMatcher from difflib library to check the contents in the file and produce the ratio of similarity.
- Lastly, I used  Streamlit module in Python to deploy the code into a web application so as to enhance User Interface.
